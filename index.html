	<p>Welcome to our wedding website! We are so happy you’re here because it means you found the place with all of the information and where to RSVP! For those of you on Luke’s side of the family, my name is Sarah and I am the bride! But I didn’t want this to be your typical little blurb about how we met solely written by me, so I’m going to write something and I’m going to have Luke write something as well. This way you can get to know us a little better as individuals and as a couple. I hope he writes something nice because I’m not going to see it until it’s done!</p>
	<h1 id="title">Our Love Story</h1>
	<p id="lovestory">Luke and I met at Michigan State, my favorite place in the whole world. We actually lived on the same floor our freshmen year of college and were acquaintances at best. That is, until March Madness came along. If you didn’t know, Luke and I both a little fanatic when it comes to Michigan State basketball. I’ll never let him live it down that he did not knock on wood when firmly stating that Michigan State would win the game easily in that 2015-16 tournament. Moving into our sophomore year, we both were taking Differential Equations at the same time and quickly became homework buddies. Our friendship grew and we starting officially dating on New Year’s Day 2017. His friends became my friends, our lives became each others, and our bond continued to strengthen every day. Luke proposed on October 15, 2020 at Uncle John’s Cider Mill, but I think I was way more nervous than he was! I am thankful everyday for how he takes care of me and loves me. I am so happy to be stepping into this next stage of life with him.</p>
